# About
______________
A simple analog WASD key and "H" button game. The game is simple: kill the enemies and find the Gem of Swag ðŸ’Ž (1/10 Drop Rate). The lower the kill count the better. Game design was based off of Space invaders and Pac-Man game development.

# Motivation
______________
This game was created for my love of MMORPGs. Inspired by games with drop rates and rare items. RNG based games have always intrigued me because people love a good grind to find items that would boosts the character stats. This is a short homage, to games that give us that dopamine when trying to find rare items for your character.

# Game Logic / Game Mechanic
______________
Created with Object Oriented programming in mind. Each class/object has X & Y coordinates. The bullets/attack event happens at the players X & Y coordinate and is put into an array. If the Mob(Moveable Objects) / enemies are in the same X & Y coordinate as the bullets then the collision will trigger a class method to reduce the Mobs health. The game takes place in a canvas element in HTML <canvas/> allowing graphical and color elements to be drawn. The top left corner of the canvas element is the origin and the game is based off of those coordinate positions.

# Improvements / Future Implementations
______________________________________
- Randomize mob movement (create mobs that move)
- Fix lose condition to end when collision and health reduction
- Add more items to boost damage or add health
- Add Pond to make a game within a game to obtain more items
- Need to map out border to prevent player from going off screen
