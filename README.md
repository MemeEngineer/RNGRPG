#RNGRPG
<br>
A simple WASD key and "H" button game. Shoot the mobs infront of you. The RNG is at 1/10. The game is simple: kill the enemies and find the Gem of Swag. The lower the kill count the better.

#Motivation
This game was created for my love of MMORPGs. Inspired by games with drop rates and rare items. RNG based games have always intrigued me because people love a good grind to find items that would boosts the character stats. This is a short homage, to games that give us that dopamine when trying to find rare items for your character.
